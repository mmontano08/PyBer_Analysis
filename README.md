# Overview of the analysis:

  The purpose of this challenge was to analyze and create a summary dataframe that will show ride sharing data by city types, such as, Urban, Suburban and Rural type of cities. Gathering this data and creating graphs allows us to understand the ridership and fare measures by city types. 
  
# Results:

The results by city types (see image below):
 - Rural cities has has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
 - Suburban cities are in the middle, having the second most drivers, rides and total fares.
 - Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
 - Even though rural cities see the least amount of drivers, rides & fares, they do have the highest avergae fare per driver.
 - Even though the urban cities have a high command in drivers, rides, and fares, they have the lowest average of fare per ride per driver.

# Summary: 
  Based on the data that we analyzed and created, we concluded different type of fares based on type of city. We were able to gather date to differentiate the types of fare based on different typesof cities and how much an average ride costs. This allows us to effectively say that rural cities will command a higher fare, possibly due to a demand of traveling to a longer distance destination and this allows it to make the average fare per driver the most out of the other city types.

  Based on the results, my three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types is to:
 - increase the amount od drivers in rural cities to ensure there are enough drivers
 - charge more in urban cities per mile based on the length of the trip
 - increase or decrease charges based on higher command in suburban cities based on time and events during active months (such as a sporting event, concert event, etc).
